I reviewed strong data analytics portfolios today.

The biggest mistake I noticed? Too many generic projects.

The best portfolios I saw today focused on:

- Real-world problems, it demonstrates your ability to navigate realtime data and extract meaningful insights from them
- Showcasing your strongest and diverse skills in your portfolio
- Clear storytelling: what was the problem, what did you find, what recommendations can you offer?

That’s what actually makes you stand out.
