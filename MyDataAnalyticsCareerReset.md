# Day 1 of building in public.

Day 1 of my 120-day data analytics career reset was more about reframing what knowing data analytics actually means. I reviewed three different data analyst job descriptions today,
and a few unfamiliar skills stood out, Postgres, machine learning concepts, more advanced SQL patterns, and product analytics tools like Amplitude.

On the other hand, it was reassuring to see that I’m comfortable with skills like SQL joins, Power BI reporting, Excel, sales analysis, and working with BI tools. 

I’ll start learning the unfamiliar skills from the basics and take it one step at a time. 

If you’ve ever done a career reset, what helped you not rush the process?
