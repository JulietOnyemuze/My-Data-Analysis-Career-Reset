Day 9 of my 120-day Data Analytics Career Reset

I spent too long today wondering why my YoY arrows were all green😭

I was analyzing a YoY comparison in Excel, something I’m more used to doing in Power BI. The logic was right but the result wasn’t.
After debugging for a while, I deleted the pivot table, rebuilt it, and everything worked instantly.

Today’s reminder:
Same concept ≠ same behaviour across tools.

Debugging is part of learning, and it's a skill itself
