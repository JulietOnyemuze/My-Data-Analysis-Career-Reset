If you're building projects right now, you need to revisit your old ones. Not to judge yourself, but to improve your thinking.

I reviewed my first data project today and noticed:
-The monthly trend chart was cluttered
-The insight wasn’t clear
-Some filters didn’t work properly

Back then, I thought it was fine, but someone I showed asked me: “What am I supposed to see here?”

That question changed how I approach analysis.

Now I design dashboards around one rule: If it needs explanation, it’s not clear enough.

Day 3/120.
