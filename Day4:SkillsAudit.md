I did a skills audit today, not based on what I “know,” but on what I can confidently execute without hesitation.

The execution gaps are that:
• I can do analysis and build dashboards in Excel, but I’m not deeply grounded in advanced formulas.
• I understand SQL joins and other concepts when I see them, but writing complex queries from scratch still challenges me.
• In Python, I’m at the beginner stage, comfortable importing pandas, but not much beyond that yet.

This exercise reminded me that knowing a tool is different from being able to execute confidently with it.

Honest self-assessment is uncomfortable, but it creates intentional growth.
